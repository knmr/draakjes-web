    <p>DRAAKJES (C9) is a Dutch professional esports organization. It was formed back in 2009, when 3 cubs decided to break lose from the chains. Their first prey was the Enemy Territory scene. It didn't take long before they made a name for themselves. Talent for aiming combined with extraordinary teamwork don't go unnoticed.</p>
    <p>The first achievement was winning ClanBase's 3rd division OpenCup in 2010. It was clear the CB organization had underestimated these brave warriors. In the following edition, DRAAKJES was placed in the grand premier division of the prestigious league. They came in second, right after the reigning champions. Many ET successes would follow. After being on top of the 3on3 scene, they decided it was time to move on.</p>
